# OrdbogenFrontend

This project the front-end part for Ordbogen test, created with AngularJS, Bootstrap, Grunt and Bower. The base structre was created with Yeoman.
The website is working on Desktop and Mobile too.

Not all the endpoints are implemented, is just a demo with `Countries` and a basic `Login`.
If is needed, the other enpoints could be implemented easier.
